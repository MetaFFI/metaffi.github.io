# MetaFFI

Have you ever wanted to use different programming languages together? With MetaFFI, you can do just that. MetaFFI lets you access functions, methods, fields, and even pass callbacks from any language you want.

MetaFFI works similar to loading a C function from a library, but it lets you use that same concept to load entities in any other language.

How awesome is that?

There's no virtual machines of any sort. Each langauges runs in its own runtime, communicating via C.

## Installation

The installation is an all-in-one, cross-platform, Python3 script. Just download and run.

Latest version [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/MetaFFI/metaffi-core/releases/download/v0.1.0/metaffi_installer.py)

Flags: <br>
**/s** - silent mode, uses default installation.<br>
**--skip-sanity** - skips all tests after installation<br>
**--include-extended-tests** - runs extended tests after installation. Installs several 3rd party libraries for tests (e.g. beautiful soup and others)

## A Simple Example

`log4j` from Python3 ([link](https://github.com/MetaFFI/lang-plugin-python3/blob/main/api/tests/extended/openjdk/log4j/log4j_test.py)):

```python
# load JVM
runtime = metaffi.metaffi_runtime.MetaFFIRuntime('openjdk')

# load log4j
log4j_api_module = runtime.load_module('log4j-api-2.21.1.jar;log4j-core-2.21.1.jar')

# load getLogger() method to get a new logger
getLogger = log4j_api_module.load('class=org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager,callable=getLogger', 
    [new_metaffi_type_with_alias(metaffi_string8_type)], 
    [new_metaffi_type_with_alias(metaffi_handle_type, 'org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger')])

# load error() method in logger
perror = log4j_api_module.load('class=org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger,callable=error,instance_required',
  [new_metaffi_type_with_alias(MetaFFITypes.metaffi_handle_type),
  new_metaffi_type_with_alias(MetaFFITypes.metaffi_string8_type)],
  None)

# create logger with getLogger()
logger = getLogger('pylogger')[0]
perror(logger, 'Logging error from python!')

runtime.release_runtime_plugin()

```

## API Usage Details & Documentation

The API is a user-friendly wrapper to MetaFFI's XLLR (Cross-Language Link Runtime) C-interface.

Detailed usage and documentation of the APIs for each of the plugins:

[Python3](/usage/python3/)

[Java Virtual Machine](/usage/jvm/)

[Go](/usage/go/)

## Function Path

*Function path* is a string describing the foreign entity in the loaded module.

In `C`, for example, a module would be a `.so/.dll/.dylib` file, and function path would be the name of the exported function.

In other languages, or other entities beside function, just a name does not suffice. Therefore, function path is build of a list of key-value pairs or tags delimited by a comma: `key1=val1,tag1,...,...,tagN,keyN=valN`.

Each plugin expects different keys and/tags. Although we try to keep the keys and tags similar across plugins, they are not identical.

The list of each runtime plugin is listed in the following links:

[Python3](/usage/function_path/python3/)

[JVM](/usage/function_path/jvm/)

[Go](/usage/function_path/go/)

## Compiler

Loading entities from the ‚Äúexecutable-code‚Äù of different runtimes is a common functionality that many runtimes offer. For instance, the JVM can load entities from .jar or .class files, while the CPython can load entities from .py or .pyc files. However, this functionality is not universally available across all runtimes, and some runtimes require the creation of entrypoints to access the entities (e.g. `Go`).

MetaFFI addresses this limitation by providing a compiler that can generate entrypoints to the foreign entities automatically.

To compile and generate entrypoints, simply run: 

`metaffi -c --idl [path] -g`

**-c** - compile<br>
**--idl** - path to source code to extract foreign entities signatures<br>
**-g** - generate "guest code"

For example, to build guest module for <p "font-family:courier;">TestRuntime.go</p>

## Supported Langauges (for now)

|Language | Supported | Tested|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----:|
| Go | From v1.18 | v1.18 &rarr; v1.21.4 |
| JVM Languages | JNI supported JVM | OpenJDK11 x64<br>Microsoft OpenJDK11 Hotspot JVM
| Python3 | v3.11  | v3.11 |

* Note: Due to a [bug](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/58542) in Go, using Go &rarr; OpenJDK in **Windows**, causes the process to crash. Fix is expected in Go1.23. In the meantime, MetaFFI install provides a temporary patch to fix the issue.

* Lack of support is not due to system limitations, but time. If you like the project, consider to contribute [add a new language support](add-language-plugin) üòä

## Supported Operating Systems (for now)

| Operating System | Supported Versions | Tested |
|:---|:---:|:----:|
| Windows | From 7 | 10, 11 |
| Ubuntu | 22.04 | 22.04 |


* Lack of support is not due to system limitations, but time. If you like the project, consider to contribute and [add a new language support](add-language-plugin) üòä

## License

## Technical Notes

**$METAFFI_HOME** - Environment variable is set to MetaFFI installation directory. In **Windows**, $METAFFI_HOME is added to PATH environment variable.

**$PYTHONHOME** must be set for Python3 support. Installer sets the environment variable.

**$JAVA_HOME** must be set for JVM support. Installer sets the evironment variable.

**$CGO_ENABLED** must be set to 1 and **\$CGO_CFLAGS** must add $METAFFI_HOME as include directory for Go support. Installer sets the environment variables.
